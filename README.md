# Hi, I'm Serkan Coskun 👋

## Senior Data Engineer | AI/ML Engineer

I build enterprise-scale data platforms and production ML systems that process millions of transactions and deliver real business value.

### 🚀 What I Do

**AI/ML Engineering:**

- **14+ production ML models** with 70%+ accuracy (XGBoost, ExtraTreesRegressor)
- RAG systems using LangChain, OpenAI, and vector databases
- Production ML pipelines processing **100K+ daily predictions**
- Knowledge Graph-powered semantic search across 10,000+ documents

**Data Engineering:**

- Real-time ETL pipelines processing **500K+ transactions daily**
- Knowledge Graph architecture on Neo4j (**1M+ nodes, 5M+ relationships**)
- Cloud infrastructure optimization (30% cost reduction on AWS)
- Data quality frameworks achieving **99.5% accuracy**

### 💻 Tech Stack

**Programming Languages:** Python, SQL, Cypher, Bash, PySpark

**Databases:** PostgreSQL, Snowflake, Neo4j, Oracle, SQL Server, Redshift

**AI/ML Frameworks:** LangChain, OpenAI, XGBoost, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Sentence-BERT, Vector Databases

**Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS (S3, SQS, Lambda, ECS, RDS), Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform

**Data Engineering Tools:** Apache Airflow, dbt, Liquibase, Pandas, NumPy

**DevOps & Other:** Git, CI/CD, Jenkins, REST APIs
